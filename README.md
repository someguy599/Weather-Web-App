This is a simple web app I made that tells you the current weather for any city you type in. Itâ€™s built with Python, Flask, and the Open-Meteo API for getting weather and location data.

Basically, you type a city name, the app figures out its location (latitude & longitude), then shows you the temperature and wind speed right now.
